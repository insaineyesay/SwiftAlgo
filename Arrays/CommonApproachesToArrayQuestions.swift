// Common Approaches in Array Interview Challenges

// While every problem is unique, here are some recurring approaches you might encounter:
// 	•	Brute Force:
// Iterating over all pairs or using nested loops. Often not optimal but a starting point for understanding the problem.
// 	•	Sorting:
// Sorting the array can simplify many problems (e.g., merging intervals, finding duplicates). Sometimes you re-sort after applying a transformation.
// 	•	Two-Pointer Technique:
// Very common with sorted arrays or when you need to compare elements from both ends. Examples include the “Squares of a Sorted Array” problem, “Container With Most Water,” and “Two Sum II.”
// 	•	Sliding Window:
// Useful for problems dealing with contiguous subarrays or strings (e.g., finding maximum subarray sum, longest substring without repeating characters).
// 	•	Hashing (Sets/Dictionaries):
// To quickly look up or count elements. This is common for problems like finding duplicates or summing pairs.
// 	•	Dynamic Programming:
// For problems that require tracking multiple subproblems, like the “Longest Increasing Subsequence” or “Maximum Subarray.”
// 	•	Binary Search:
// When dealing with sorted arrays and you need to quickly find a target or a boundary.

// Understanding these patterns will help you choose the right approach based on the problem’s characteristics. With practice, you’ll start to recognize these patterns more quickly.
